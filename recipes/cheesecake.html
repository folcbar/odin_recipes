        <h1>The Classic Cheesecake</h1>
        <img src="creamy-classic-cheesecake-recipe-600x900.jpg" alt="Picture of a cheesecake">
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Cheesecake is a sweet dessert consisting of one or more layers. The main, and thickest, layer consists of a mixture of a soft,<br> 
        fresh cheese (typically cottage cheese, cream cheese or ricotta), eggs, and sugar.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <h5>Graham Cracker Crust</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>1 and 1/2 cups (150g) <strong>graham cracker crumbs</strong> (about 10 full sheet graham crackers)</li>
            <li>5 Tablespoons (70g) unsalted <strong>butter</strong>, melted</li>
            <li>1/4 cup (50g) <strong>granulated sugar</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Cheesecake</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>four 8-ounce blocks (904g) full-fat <strong>cream cheese</strong>, softened to room temperature</li>
            <li>1 cup (200g) <strong>granulated sugar</strong></li>
            <li>1 cup (240g) full-fat <strong>sour cream, at room temperature</strong></li>
            <li>1 teaspoon <strong>pure vanilla extract</strong></li>
            <li>2 teaspoons <strong>fresh lemon juice</strong> (optional, but recommended)</li>
            <li>3 large <strong>eggs</strong>, at room temperature</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Adjust the oven rack to the lower-middle position and preheat oven to 350°F (177°C).</li>
            <li><strong>Make the crust:</strong> Using a food processor, pulse the graham crackers into crumbs. Pour into a medium bowl <br>
            stir in sugar and melted butter until combined.(You can also pulse it all together in the food processor.) Mixture will be sandy. <br>
            Press firmly into the bottom and slightly up the sides of a <a href="https://amzn.to/2rciOkd">9-inch</a> or <a href="https://amzn.to/2rczffs">10-inch</a> springform pan. <br>
            No need to grease the pan first. I use the bottom of a measuring cup to pack the crust down tightly. Pre-bake for 8 minutes. <br>
            Remove from the oven and place the hot pan on a large piece of aluminum foil. The foil will wrap around the pan for the water bath in step 4. <br>
            Allow crust to slightly cool as you prepare the filling.</li>
            <li><strong>Make the filling:</strong> Using a handheld or <a href="https://rstyle.me/n/c34csqb7kf7">stand mixer</a> fitted with a paddle attachment, <br> 
            beat the cream cheese and granulated sugar together on medium-high speed in a large bowl until the mixture is smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. <br>
            Add the sour cream, vanilla extract, and lemon juice then beat until fully combined. On medium speed, add the eggs one at a time,<br>
            beating after each addition until just blended. After the final egg is incorporated into the batter, stop mixing. To help prevent the cheesecake<br> 
            from deflating and cracking as it cools, avoid over-mixing the batter as best you can.</li>
            <li><strong>Prepare the simple water bath (see note):</strong> Watch my video tutorial above; the visual guide will assist you in this step! Boil a pot of water. <br>
            You need 1 inch of water in your roasting pan for the water bath, so make sure you boil enough. I use an entire kettle of hot water. <br>
            As the water is heating up, wrap the aluminum foil around the springform pan. Pour the cheesecake batter on top of the crust. <br>
            Use a rubber spatula or spoon to smooth it into an even layer. Place the pan inside of a large roasting pan. Carefully pour the hot water inside <br> 
            of the pan and place in the oven. (Or you can place the roasting pan in the oven first, then pour the hot water in. Whichever is easier for you.)</li>
            <li>(Note: if you notice the cheesecake browning too quickly on top, tent it with aluminum foil halfway through baking.) Bake cheesecake for 55-70 minutes or<br>
            until the center is almost set. When it’s done, the center of the cheesecake will slightly wobble if you gently shake the pan. Turn the oven off and open <br>
            the oven door slightly. Let the cheesecake sit in the oven in the water bath as it cools down for 1 hour. Remove from the oven and water bath, then cool <br>
            cheesecake completely uncovered at room temperature. Then cover and refrigerate the cheesecake for at least 4 hours or overnight.</li>
            <li>Use a knife to loosen the chilled cheesecake from the rim of the springform pan, then remove the rim. Using a clean sharp knife, cut into slices for serving. <br>
            For neat slices, wipe the knife clean and dip into warm water between each slice.</li>
            <li>Serve cheesecake with desired toppings. Cover and store leftover cheesecake in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.</li>
